# 42-Gomuku
This project involves creating, in the language of your choice, a Gomoku game integrating an AI player capable of beating a human player the fastest way possible. To do this, you will implement a min-max algorithm but also do research, trial and error to find the most adapted heuristics. This will not be as easy as checkers.
