- [] give each move a score based on their priority
- [] sort all the previous moves by priority

- create a limited in depth Mini-Max to sort the top 3 moves + the multiple move

- 5th capture
- non brekable 5 in row

// review those games:

// to fix:
// `J8,I7,I9,K7,H10,J7,H7,I6,I5,I8,H9,G9,K6`
// `I9,H8,J8,H10,K7,H9,H7,H11,H12,I10,J11,G8,G12,I12,F12,J9,I11,K11,I11,F7,E6,G13` should have went for 5ith piece
// `I9,H8,J8,K7,H10,H7,H6,H9,I11,J12,G9,J11,J13,J10,I12,I13,H14,H11,K11,J12,K14,J9,I7,G5,I14,G14,K12,H15,I16,F13,L15,M16,J15,L13,J14,K16,K10,G12,E14,G13,G11,E12,F12` that was intense game with minimax (depth=1), the last move will be considered
// handle the case of : "when the opponent play a breakable 5 in row" you have to break it
